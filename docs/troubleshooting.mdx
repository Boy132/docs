## "500 | SERVER ERROR" on Panel

Check your panel logs for errors by running the following command.

```sh
tail -n 100 /var/www/pelican/storage/logs/laravel-$(date +%F).log | grep "\[$(date +%Y)"
```

If the command above doesn't return anything you most likely have wrong permissions for your `storage` folder. So you first need to fix that.  
You can set the correct permissions by running `chmod -R 755 /var/www/pelican/storage/* /var/www/pelican/bootstrap/cache/`. Also make sure that your panel files are owned by the correct user.

### Some common errors

* `ErrorException: file_put_contents(_____): failed to open stream: Permission denied`: Wrong file permissions/ ownership for the panel files, see above.
* `Connection timed out after 5001 miliseconds for _______:8080`: Your panel can't reach wings, see the wings connections issues steps below.
* `Connection refused [tcp://_______:6379]`: Redis isn't running or isn't reachable for some other reason. (start by checking the status of the redis service: `systemctl status redis-server`)

## Wings connection issues

### Checking the wings service

First you should make sure that the wings service is running. To do that run `systemctl status wings`.  
It should say that the service is active and running. If its in a failed state run `sudo wings diagnostics` to check the wings logs for errors.

Some common error in the wings logs are:

* `failed to configure HTTPS server auto_tls=false error=open /etc/letsencrypt/live/_____________/fullchain.pem: no such file or directory`: The SSL certificate for wings is missing, see [this guide](./guides/ssl) for creating a SSL certificate.
* `TODO: wrong wings token error`: Your wings token is wrong, you need [update the token in your config.yml file](./wings/install#configure)
* `failed to recieve server configurations: Error response from Panel: _MissingResponseCode: No error response returned from API endpoint. (HTTP/403)`: Your panel is not responding correctly. This usually happens when Cloudflare is blocking the connection. In that case make sure your wings ip is added to the Cloudflare firewall. If you aren't using Cloudflare it might be some other CDN/ DDoS protection service or your provider.
* `TODO: could not unmarshal response`: This is basically the same error as above: Cloudflare is blocking the connection.

### Checking the wings port

If you confirmed that wings is running without errors you should make sure that the wings port (`8080` by default) isn't blocked by any firewall. The best way to check this is to use online port checkers like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org/port-scanner.php)  
It should say "open" if you check for your node FQDN (e.g. `node.example.com` or `123.123.123.123`) and your wings port (e.g. `8080`). If it says "timed-out" you have some firewall blocking the port. This could be an internal firewall (like iptables) or an external firewall (e.g. from your provider).

### Check for NAT loopback

If your panel and wings are on the same machine or same network and you are using domains you should check for NAT loopback issues.  
Edit the `/etc/hosts` file on your panel/ wings machine and add an entry for your ip and domain.

### Checking the wings connection

If you confirmed the above two points you have to do some advanced troubleshooting.

Check if your panel and your browser can connect to wings.  
* **For the Panel <-> Wings connection:**  
run `curl <protocol><node fqdn>:<node port>` (e.g. `curl https://node.example.com:8080` or `curl http://123.123.123.123:8080`) on your panel machine and see what it outputs.
* **For the Browser <-> Wings connection:**  
open `<protocol><node fqdn>:<node port>` (e.g. `https://node.example.com:8080` or `http://123.123.123.123:8080`) in your browser and see what it outputs.

If the connection was successful it should output something like this:
```
{"error":"The required authorization heads were not present in the request."}
```
