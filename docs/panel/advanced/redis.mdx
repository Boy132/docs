# Redis

### Queue Listener

We make use of queues to make the application faster and handle sending emails and other actions in the background.
You will need to setup the queue worker for these actions to be processed.

#### Creating Queue Worker

Next you need to create a new systemd worker to keep our queue process running in the background. This queue is responsible
for sending emails and handling many other background tasks.

Create a file called `pelican.service` in `/etc/systemd/system` with the contents below.

```ini {11,12} title="/etc/systemd/system/pelican.service"
# Pelican Queue File
# ----------------------------------

[Unit]
Description=Pelican Queue Service
After=redis-server.service

[Service]
# On some systems the user and group might be different.
# Some systems use `apache` or `nginx` as the user and group.
User=www-data
Group=www-data
Restart=always
ExecStart=/usr/bin/php /var/www/pelican/artisan queue:work --queue=high,standard,low --sleep=3 --tries=3
StartLimitInterval=180
StartLimitBurst=30
RestartSec=5s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

<Admonition type="info" title="Redis on Rocky Linux">
    If you are using Rocky Linux, you will need to replace `redis-server.service` with `redis.service` at the `After=` line in order to ensure `redis` starts before the queue worker.

If you are using redis for your system, you will want to make sure to enable that it will start on boot. You can do that by running the following command:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now redis-server
```

Finally, enable the service and set it to boot on machine start.

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now pelican.service
```
