As some of you know, people have been asking us questions about when you need a commercial license or not.

I asked people for questions they wanted clarifications on, and here are some answers. 

## modification questions

1.  Q: What are the plans for the theming part of Pelican Panel and what will the front end look like?

    A: Using [Filament themes](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/themes#creating-a-custom-theme) placed in `/resources/css/filament` will work and don't need a license, 
    and so long as no files that are included with the panel are modified in the process, you do not need a commercial license.

:::info
    A theme selector will eventually be implemented.
:::
:::warning
    Themes are unable to change the layout of the panel, but plugins can.
:::
:::info definitions
    Theme: The color and style of the panel. (Ex. button colors or fonts)  
    Layout: The way the panel is organized. (Ex. where the cpu usage shows up.)
    Panel Code: The files that the panel ship with.
:::

2.  Q: Will only styling be a thing, or is there also some sort of support for custom layouts and functionalities?

    A: Custom layouts can be made with either plugins or by writing a custom frontend that uses the API to interact with the panel.

3.  Q: Some users will probably use "public" themes for the panel (maybe smth like unix or so), if they are a public host, since they aren't the ones making the theme, do they need to pay the commercial license?

    A: The answer for question 1 should answer this, but if a theme is public (as in open source) and does not modify the panel code if should be fine.

:::warning
    If it is closed source and modifies the panel code the host would have to get a license.

## not license related
    Still good questions

1.  Q: What kind of SLA are you guys proposing for any commercial support plans?

    A: Currently this depends on what level of support a customer would want. We are discussing options internally right now.

2.  Q: Would it be possible for you guys to add a real data panel like splint or grafana or netdata for the server metrics?

    A: Currently exporting server metrics to a service like Grafana is not planned but may be considered.
:::info
    As discussed on the discord server this may be better served by a monitoring service such as a host level netdata install.

3.  Q: When Pelican goes public, will conversions be considered?

    A: You can use your existing Pterodactyl configuration and drop in Pelican, it will update the database when installed.  
:::warning
    This would not be reversible at this time and it is heavily recommended that you back up your current configuration if you ever want to go back to Pterodactyl.   
:::
:::info
    Wings is not a one way conversion, at this time, as it has far fewer changes that impact things.
